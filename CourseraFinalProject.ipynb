Based on that data, we are going to identify the most popular areas for restaurants and food stores to begin, as they have the highest chance of attracting customers in those areas. We are going to use the data of the venues to cluster them into groups to find the busiest and most business filled areas in the Bay Area to find the best location for us to start a new business. "
